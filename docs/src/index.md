## Introduction

This package serves to provide the necessary tools to perform net survival analysis, a branch of survival analysis dedicated to estimating the probability of survival from a particular event of interest compared to the general public. Some key features in `NetSurvival.jl` are:

- Fitting different non-parametric estimators (Pohar Perme[PoharPerme2012](@cite), Ederer II, ...)
- Applying Graff√©o's log-rank test[GraffeoTest](@cite) on different groups, including stratified covariables 
- ...
